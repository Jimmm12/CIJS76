        My name is Nam. I am currently a high school student. Most of my time is
        spent studying. In my free time I mostly listen to music. This is my
        preference. I listen to music anytime, anywhere. Music helps me balance
        my emotions. In times of sadness I will listen to songs with a funny
        rhythm to improve my mood. In      times of stress I will look to songs with
        a gentle melody to relax. The music that I like the most is ballad
        music. I really like Son Tung M-TP’s “This Place With You” song. When I
        choose a song to listen to, I not only focus on its melody but I also
        pay attention to its lyrics. There are many songs that suit my mood. It
        sounds good. Music is created by musicians to speak the hearts of many
        people I love and cherish it.
